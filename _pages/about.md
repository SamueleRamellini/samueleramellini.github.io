I'm a Biogeosciences Master student at the University of Milan and a Visiting Student in the Safi lab at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour (MPIAB). During my Bachelor I worked on the foraging behaviour of the Lesser kestrel (<i>Falco naumanni<i>), a small colonial raptor. During my Master, I'm aiming at disentangle the effect of environmental conditions (as a proxy for resource availability) on the migration and non-breeding ecology in the same species. Apart from my master project Iâ€™m also analyzing, within the Safi Lab (MPIAB), how the lesser kestrels use environmental cues during their foraging activities, focusing on the effect of wind and remote-sensing-derived mowing periods. 
  Thus, I'm integrating cutting-edge technologies (GPS tracking and big databases) with remote sensing products as well as on-field environmental sensors, aiming at unravelling the multiple factors affecting foraging decisions.
